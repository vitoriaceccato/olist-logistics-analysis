# 📦 Olist Logistics Delay Analysis  

## 🎯 Business Question  
What structurally drives extreme delivery delays, and where should operational efforts be prioritized for maximum impact?

## 📊 Dataset  
~96K delivered orders  
Grain: 1 row = 1 delivered order  
Primary metric: Lead time (purchase → delivery)

## 🔎 Core Findings  

### 1️⃣ Transport is the structural bottleneck  
Highest mean (9.28 days) and highest variability among all process stages.

### 2️⃣ Delays are tail-driven, not average-driven  
4.4% of orders exceed 30 days (IQR-based threshold).  
Performance instability is concentrated in extreme cases rather than the core flow.

### 3️⃣ Geography materially increases delay risk  
Interstate orders show ~9x higher extreme-delay probability  
(3.9% vs 0.4% intrastate).

North (11.8%) and Northeast (8.2%) exhibit structurally elevated delay rates.

### 4️⃣ Route concentration drives operational impact  
Top excess-delay routes originate from São Paulo:

- SP → RJ  
- SP → BA  
- SP → PA  
- SP → CE  

High volume combined with above-benchmark delay rates generates the greatest operational burden.

### 5️⃣ Route explains delays better than isolated geography  
MAE comparison:

- Route (origin + destination): **0.0465**  
- Destination only: 0.0496  
- Origin only: 0.0516  

Delays are best explained at the route level rather than by origin or destination alone.

## 🏆 Strategic Conclusion  

Delivery delays are structural to the logistics network design rather than isolated regional inefficiencies.

Route-level prioritization offers materially higher business leverage than state-level intervention.
